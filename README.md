## From eigenvector nonlinearities to eigenvalue nonlinearities

Code supporting the numerical experiments and illustrative examples in the article *From eigenvector nonlinearities to eigenvector nonlinearities* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16182). 

The code necessary for recreating the numerical examples is found in num_exp.jl, and the associated data used to create the figures are also available under data/.
