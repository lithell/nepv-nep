# From eigenvector nonlinearities to eigenvector nonlinearities

Code supporting the numerical experiments and illustrative examples in the article *From eigenvector nonlinearities to eigenvector nonlinearities* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16182). 

The code necessary for recreating the data from the numerical examples is found in num_exp.jl.
